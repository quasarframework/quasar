Reporting a bug?
================
- Are you sure it isn't already reported? Do a search first! It may have already been answered or even fixed in the development branch (`dev`).

- If you are reporting a bug for Quasar v0.15+, then please try to include a forked JsFiddle/Codepen from one of these: https://jsfiddle.net/rstoenescu/waugrryy/ (jsFiddle - Material theme) or https://jsfiddle.net/rstoenescu/7gu065yg/ (jsFiddle - iOS theme) or https://codepen.io/rstoenescu/pen/KQRZJg (Codepen - Material theme) or https://codepen.io/rstoenescu/pen/paVpBN (Codepen - iOS theme)

- Check if the issue is reproducible with the latest stable version of Quasar. If you are using a pre-release, please indicate the specific version you are using.

- It is **required** that you clearly describe the steps necessary to reproduce the issue you are running into. Issues with no clear repro steps will not be triaged. If an issue labeled "need repro" receives no further input from the issue author for more than 5 days, it will be closed.

- If your issue is resolved but still open, don’t hesitate to close it. In case you found a solution by yourself, it could be helpful to explain how you fixed it.
