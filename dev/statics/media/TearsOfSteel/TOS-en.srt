1
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,500
You're a jerk, Thom.

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Look Celia, we have to follow our passions;

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,500
...you have your robotics, and I
just want to be awesome in space.

4
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,000
Why don't you just admit that
you're freaked out by my robot hand?

5
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm not freaked out by- it's...

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
...alright! Fine!

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I'm freaked out! I have nightmares
that I'm being chased...

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
...by these giant robotic claws of death...

9
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,000
"Fourty years later"
Whatever, Thom. We're done.


10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,500
Robot's memory synced and locked!

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
This is pretty freaky.

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Shouldn't you be down there?

13
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I heard you guys talking last night.

14
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's not my fault, you know.

15
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Are you ready?

16
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Of course you're ready, you're a rockstar.

17
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
How's it looking, Barley?

18
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We should have about ten minutes...

19
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,000
Well that's perfect.

20
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,500
We're on in one! All systems go!
Yeah you, go! 

21
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Go! Move your asses! Go go go! 

22
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I love it! Come on, go!

23
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
That's nice. 

24
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,700
Nothing to worry about.

25
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Thom.

26
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
There she is.

27
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,500
Now.

28
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You love her.

29
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,500
She is your passion! 

30
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Be tender to her. 

31
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,500
Be honest! Eh- be tender.

32
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Remind her what love is.

33
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
...and, action!

34
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,000
Memory overwrite in progress!

35
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You're a jerk, Thom!

36
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,000
Ohp- Sorry! Sorry.

37
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Look Celia.

38
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
We have to follow our passions. 

39
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You have your robotics...

40
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
...and I just want to be awesome in space.

41
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Okay, they're coming. Two minutes left!

42
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Speed it up, Thom! 

43
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Vivacissimo!

44
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Why don't you just admit that you're 
freaked out by my robot hand?

45
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Listen Celia, I was young...

46
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,000
...and a dick. 

47
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
But that's no reason to
destroy the world.

48
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Why does he do this?

49
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,500
We already tried that one!

50
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:12,500
Abort!

51
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Cut!

52
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Whoaaa!

53
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Whoaaa!

54
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Nooooo!

55
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
You broke my heart.

56
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I know.

57
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You forgot me on earth.

58
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I know.

59
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,000
I should just crush you.

60
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm-

61
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Good ad-lib.

63
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,500
Not my fault!

64
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
This time.

65
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,500
Quiet on set!

66
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
We're out of time!

67
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Come on!

68
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
RAAAAAAAAH!

69
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Memory overwrite, 90%.

70
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Captain! We have to abort!

71
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The world's changed, Celia...

72
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
...maybe we can too.

73
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Memory overwrite complete!

74
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You know.

75
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
There's a lesson to be learned from this.

76
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Could'a gone worse.
