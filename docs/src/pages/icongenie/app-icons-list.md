desc: List of the app icons and splash screens that are generated by the Icon Genie CLI based on the Quasar mode.

Each Quasar CLI mode requires its own list of icons and splash screens.
These are taken care of by Icon Genie through its [generate](/icongenie/command-list#generate) command.

Here are the links to each mode's list:
