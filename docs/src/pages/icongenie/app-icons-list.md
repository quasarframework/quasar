desc: List of the app icons and splash screens that are generated by the Icon Genie CLI based on the Quasar mode.

Each Quasar CLI mode requires its own list of icons and splash screens.
These are taken care of by Icon Genie through its [generate](/icongenie/command-list#generate) command.

Here are the links to each mode's list:

* [App Icons for SPA mode](/quasar-cli/developing-spa/app-icons-spa)
* [App Icons for PWA mode](/quasar-cli/developing-pwa/app-icons-pwa)
* [App Icons for SSR mode](/quasar-cli/developing-ssr/app-icons-ssr)
* [App Icons for Cordova mode](/quasar-cli/developing-cordova-apps/app-icons-cordova)
* [App Icons for Capacitor mode](/quasar-cli/developing-capacitor-apps/app-icons-capacitor)
* [App Icons for Electron mode](/quasar-cli/developing-electron-apps/app-icons-electron)
* [App Icons for BEX mode](/quasar-cli/developing-browser-extensions/app-icons-browser-extension)
