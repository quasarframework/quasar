title: Providing a directive
desc: Tips and tricks on how to provide a Vue directive to the host app of a Quasar App Extension.
---

This guide is for when you want to create a new directive and provide it through an App Extension, which will inject it into the hosting app.

::: tip
To create an App Extension project folder, please first read the [Development Guide > Introduction](/app-extensions/development-guide/introduction).
:::

::: tip Full Example
To see an example of what we will build, head over to [MyDirective full example](https://github.com/quasarframework/app-extension-examples/tree/master/my-directive), which is a github repo with this App Extension.
:::

Create a folder structure to keep your code modularized and organized. For instance, for a directive, create a structure that looks like this:

```bash
.
├── package.json
└── src
    ├── boot                         # folder to contain 'boot' code
    │   └── register-my-directive.js # boot file for component
    ├── directive                    # folder to contain component
    │   └── MyDirective.js           # directive file
    └── index.js                     # Described in Index API
```

Now, you need to handle registering your Vue directive. You do this with the `/index.js` file (described in the [Index API](/app-extensions/development-guide/index-api)) that was created when you set up your new App Extension.

Let's break it down.

```js
// file: /index.js
module.exports = function (api) {
  // (Optional!)
  // Quasar compatibility check; you may need
  // hard dependencies, as in a minimum version of the "quasar"
  // package or a minimum version of "@quasar/app" CLI
  api.compatibleWith('quasar', '^1.0.0')
  api.compatibleWith('@quasar/app', '^1.0.0')

  // Here we extend /quasar.conf.js, so we can add
  // a boot file which registers our new Vue directive;
  // "extendConf" will be defined below (keep reading the tutorial)
  api.extendQuasarConf(extendConf)
}
```

The first group does a compatibility check with Quasar (which is optional, but recommended). If your component is using features of Quasar that were available after a certain version, you can make sure that the version of Quasar installed is the correct one.

::: tip
Not only can you do a `api.compatibleWith()` to check against Quasar packages, but with any other available packages (that you do not supply yourself through your App Extension) as well. Please read [Handling package dependencies](/app-extensions/development-guide/introduction#Handling-package-dependencies) section from the App Extension Development Guide > Introduction page for more information.
:::

The second group tells Quasar to call our custom function when the `extendQuasarConf` CLI life-cycle hook is called. It would look something like this:

```js
// file: /index.js
function extendConf (conf) {
  // make sure my-directive boot file is registered
  conf.boot.push('~quasar-app-extension-my-directive/src/boot/register-my-directive.js')

  // make sure boot & other files get transpiled
  conf.build.transpileDependencies.push(/quasar-app-extension-my-directive[\\/]src/)
}
```

Finally, let's see how the boot file would look like. Make sure that you read the [Boot files](/quasar-cli/boot-files) documentation and understand what a Boot file is first.

```js
// file: /src/boot/my-directive.js
import Vue from 'vue'
import MyDirective from '../directive/MyDirective.js'

// We globally register our directive with Vue;
// Remember that all directives in Vue will start with 'v-'
// but that should not be part of your directive name
// https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/custom-directive.html
// 'my-directive' will be used as 'v-my-directive'
Vue.directive('my-directive', MyDirective)
```
