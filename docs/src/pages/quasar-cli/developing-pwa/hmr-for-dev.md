desc: How to manage HMR (Hot Module Reload) with Quasar PWA.

**When in develop mode** (not production), having a Service Worker installed and running will mess with the HMR (Hot Module Reload). However, the browser can be configured to bypass for network instead of using the Service Worker's cache.

When your development activity does not include configuring the Service Worker (like when editing the "/src-pwa/register-service-worker.js" file), then you can safely trigger the `$ quasar dev -m spa` (instead of `$ quasar dev -m pwa`) command to avoid the extra hassle of paying attention to the effects of the Service Worker -- which sometimes may get in the way.
