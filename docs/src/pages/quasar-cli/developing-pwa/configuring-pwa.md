We'll be using Quasar CLI to develop and build a PWA. The difference between building a SPA, Mobile App, Electron App, PWA or SSR is simply determined by the "mode" parameter in "quasar dev" and "quasar build" commands.

## Installation
In order to build a PWA, we first need to add the PWA mode to our Quasar project:
```bash
$ quasar mode add pwa
```

If you want to jump right in and start developing, you can skip the "quasar mode" command and issue:
```bash
$ quasar dev -m pwa
```
This will add PWA mode automatically, if it is missing.

## Service Worker
Adding PWA mode to a Quasar project means a new folder will be created: `/src-pwa`, which contains PWA specific files:
```bash
.
└── src-pwa/
    ├── register-service-worker.js  # App-code *managing* service worker
    └── custom-service-worker.js    # Optional custom service worker file
```

You can freely edit these files. Notice a few things:

1. `register-service-worker.js` is automatically imported into your app (like any other /src file). It registers the service worker (created by Workbox or your custom one, depending on workbox plugin mode -- quasar.conf.js > pwa > workboxPluginMode) and you can listen for Service Worker's events. You can use ES6 code.
2. `custom-service-worker.js` will be your service worker file ONLY if workbox plugin mode is set to "InjectManifest" (quasar.conf.js > pwa > workboxPluginMode: 'InjectManifest'). Otherwise, Workbox will create a service-worker file for you.
3. It makes sense to run [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) tests on production builds only.

::: tip
Read more on `register-service-worker.js` and how to interact with the Service Worker on [Handling Service Worker](/quasar-cli/developing-pwa/handling-service-worker) documentation page.

## Quasar.conf.js
This is the place where you can configure Workbox's behavior and also tweak your manifest.json.

```js
pwa: {
  // workboxPluginMode: 'InjectManifest',
  // workboxOptions: {},
  manifest: {
    // ...
  },

  // variables used to inject specific PWA
  // meta tags (below are default values)
  metaVariables: {
    appleMobileWebAppCapable: 'yes',
    appleMobileWebAppStatusBarStyle: 'default',
    appleTouchIcon120: 'statics/icons/apple-icon-120x120.png',
    appleTouchIcon180: 'statics/icons/apple-icon-180x180.png',
    appleTouchIcon152: 'statics/icons/apple-icon-152x152.png',
    appleTouchIcon167: 'statics/icons/apple-icon-167x167.png',
    appleSafariPinnedTab: 'statics/icons/safari-pinned-tab.svg',
    msapplicationTileImage: 'statics/icons/ms-icon-144x144.png',
    msapplicationTileColor: '#000000'
  }
}
```

::: warning
If you use the `injectManifest` workbox plugin mode, you **must not** set any workboxOptions, because injecting your own is basically entirely a custom approach and you are required to do everything manually. However, this shouldn't stop you from doing anything that Workbox can do.
:::

More information: [Workbox Webpack Plugin](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-webpack-plugin), [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/).

The `metaVariables` Object is used by Quasar itself only (has no meaning for Workbox) to inject specific value attributes to some PWA meta tags into the rendered HTML page. Example: `<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style">` will have value attribute assigned to the content of `metaVariables.appleMobileWebAppStatusBarStyle`.

## Configuring Manifest File
The Manifest file is generated by Quasar CLI with a default configuration for it. You can however tweak this configuration from `/quasar.conf.js`.

Example taken from Quasar Play's quasar.conf.js:
```js
pwa: {
  // workboxPluginMode: 'InjectManifest',
  // workboxOptions: {},
  manifest: {
    name: 'Quasar Play',
    short_name: 'Quasar-Play',
    description: 'Quasar Framework Showcase',
    icons: [
      {
        'src': 'statics/icons/icon-128x128.png',
        'sizes': '128x128',
        'type': 'image/png'
      },
      {
        'src': 'statics/icons/icon-192x192.png',
        'sizes': '192x192',
        'type': 'image/png'
      },
      {
        'src': 'statics/icons/icon-256x256.png',
        'sizes': '256x256',
        'type': 'image/png'
      },
      {
        'src': 'statics/icons/icon-384x384.png',
        'sizes': '384x384',
        'type': 'image/png'
      },
      {
        'src': 'statics/icons/icon-512x512.png',
        'sizes': '512x512',
        'type': 'image/png'
      }
    ],
    display: 'standalone',
    orientation: 'portrait',
    background_color: '#ffffff',
    theme_color: '#027be3'
  }
}
```

Please read about the [manifest config](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest) before diving in.

::: warning
Note that you don't need to edit your index.html file (generated from `/src/index.template.html`) to link to the manifest file. Quasar CLI takes care of embedding the right things for you.

## PWA Checklist
More info: [PWA Checklist](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/checklist)

::: danger
Do not run [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) on your development build because at this stage the code is intentionally not optimized and contains embedded source maps (among many other things). See the [Testing and Auditing](/quasar-cli/testing-and-auditing) section of these docs for more information.
:::

## Reload & Update Workbox
For those who want to reload the page when the service worker is updated, you may as well want to make it active at once. Update the workboxOptions config in quasar.conf.js as follows:

```js
pwa: {
  workboxOptions: {
    skipWaiting: true,
    clientsClaim: true
  }
}
```
