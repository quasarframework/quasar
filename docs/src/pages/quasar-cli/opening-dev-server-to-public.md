title: Opening Your Dev Server to the Public
---
At some point you may want to show someone else the project you've been working on. Fortunately, there is a simple CLI tool to accomplish this. [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) creates a tunnel to your dev server and (by default) generates a hexadecimal internet address on the ngrok server to offer to your clients or anyone special you'd like to show your work to.

::: warning
Opening dev server to the public constitutes security risks. Be absolutely cautious when using tools like this.

When you've finished with your demonstration or testing, make sure to stop ngrok. This will prevent any unwanted access of your computer through ngrok.
:::

## Getting started

1. Download and install ngrok [here](https://ngrok.com/download).
(Please note that the ngrok executable file does not need to be placed in or run from inside your cordova folder. When on a mac it's best to place the ngrok executable file inside `/usr/local/bin` to be able to run it globally.)

2. Start your Dev server
``` bash
$ quasar dev
```

3. Create your ngrok connection
``` bash
$ ngrok http 8080
# In case your development server doesn't run on port 8080 you need to change the number to the correct port
```

4. ngrok shows the url in the command line when it started.
``` bash
Tunnel Status                 online
Version                       2.0/2.0
Web Interface                 http://127.0.0.1:4040
Forwarding                    http://92832de0.ngrok.io -> localhost:8080
Forwarding                    https://92832de0.ngrok.io -> localhost:8080

Connnections                  ttl     opn     rt1     rt5     p50     p90
                              0       0       0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00
```
Please be careful as the 'Forwarding' URL will be accessible to anyone until this connection is closed again.

## Inspecting traffic

When running ngrok, visit `http://localhost:4040` to inspect the traffic.

This tool allows for custom domains, password protection and a lot more. If you require further assistance, please refer to the [ngrok docs](https://ngrok.com/docs) for more information.
