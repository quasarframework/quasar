title: SEO

The term `SEO` refers to `Search Engine Optimization`. And Quasar covers this aspect too through the [Meta Plugin](/quasar-plugins/meta).

## Meta plugin

The [Meta Plugin](/quasar-plugins/meta) can dynamically change page title, manage `<meta>` tags, manage `<html>` and `<body>` DOM element attributes, add/remove/change `<style>` and `<script>` tags in the head of your document (useful for CDN stylesheets or for json-ld markup, for example), or manage `<noscript>` tags.

::: tip
This Quasar plugin has the most tight integration with Quasar and so it has the best performance against any other similar solution.
