title: Deploying SSR
desc: How to publish a Quasar server-side rendered app.
---
When deploying as a SPA or PWA, the distributables folder that gets generated by Quasar CLI can be served by a static webserver. However, this not the case with a SSR (Server-side Render) build. Your distributables, in this case, contain your production webserver too -- which can be tweaked from `/src-ssr`.

By default, the SSR distributables use [Express](https://expressjs.com/), but you can replace it with your webserver of choice.

## The Distributables Folder
After building your app on SSR mode (`$ quasar build -m ssr`) the folder that gets generated contains a standalone webserver tweaked for serving with SSR.

You'll notice that it contains a `package.json` file of its own. It has an npm script defined, called "start":

```js
"scripts": {
  "start": "node index.js"
}
```

So what you need to do when deploying is to copy this distributables folder on your server, yarn/npm install the dependencies inside it, then run `$ yarn start`. This boots up the webserver and starts listening for connections.

::: tip
The distributables folder generated after building your app is standalone. It does NOT require the rest of your project folder to work and it does NOT depend on `@quasar/cli` being installed.

## Enhancing Performance
By default, the webserver runs on only one of the available server's cores. What you could do is make it use all cores. There is a solution for this: [PM2](http://pm2.keymetrics.io/).

After installing PM2 on your server, your npm start script can look like this instead:
```js
"scripts": {
  "start": "pm2 start index.js"
}
```

## Deploying with Now.sh
Deploying with [Now](https://zeit.co/now) is a breeze. All you need to do is to follow their [installation instructions](https://zeit.co/now#get-started). They recommend downloading "Now Desktop" but you can skip that and directly install the Now CLI:

```bash
$ npm install -g now
$ now login
```

There are several ways to use the v1 of now's services:

The robust way is to add the following file to `/dist/ssr/now.json` , and it should look like this:
```
{
  "name": "Your Project Name",
  "version": 1
}
```

And then cd into the distributables folder and run `$ now`. If you do it this way, then you can also execute directly from a github repo, but we'll leave the details of setting that up to you.

If you prefer, however, to set the version from the command line, you can also run `now -V 1`.

At any rate, you might want to use a "now alias" or connect your domain to Now. And you're done!

`Now.sh` will install the dependencies automatically then run `$ yarn start`. Your website will be up and running on an HTTPS connection in a matter of seconds!
