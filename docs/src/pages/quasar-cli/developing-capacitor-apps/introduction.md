[Capacitor](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com) is a framework to deploy web applications to mobile. It is maintained by Ionic Framework and designed as a modern alternative to Cordova. It supports most, but not all Cordova plugins, as well as Capacitor-specific plugins (called APIs). It exposes native device APIs in the form of JavaScript modules.

::: tip
For running Capacitor mode you will need @quasar/app v1.2+ and also "quasar" v1.2+.
