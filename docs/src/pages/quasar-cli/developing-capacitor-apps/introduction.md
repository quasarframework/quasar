[Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com) is a cross-platform native runtime for deploying web applications to mobile. It is maintained by [Ionic](https://ionic.io) and designed as a modern successor to Cordova. It supports most, but not all Cordova plugins, as well as Capacitor-specific plugins (called APIs). It exposes native device APIs in the form of JavaScript modules.
