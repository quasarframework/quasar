title: What is Capacitor
desc: Introduction on one of the technologies behind Quasar hybrid mobile apps.
---

[Capacitor](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com) is a framework to deploy web applications to mobile. It is maintained by Ionic Framework and designed as a modern alternative to Cordova. It supports most, but not all Cordova plugins, as well as Capacitor-specific plugins (called APIs). It exposes native device APIs in the form of JavaScript modules.

::: tip
For running Capacitor mode you will need @quasar/app v1.2+ and also "quasar" v1.2+.
:::

::: warning
Capacitor support in Quasar CLI is currently in a short beta stage. Things may break, and you should not use this in a production environment yet. If you find any issues, please report them on the [Quasar Github Repo](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar) after carefully reading these docs pages.
