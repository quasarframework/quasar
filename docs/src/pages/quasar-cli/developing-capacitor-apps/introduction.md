title: What is Capacitor
---

[Capacitor](https://capacitor.ionicframework.com) is a framework to deploy web applications to mobile. It is designed as a modern alternative to Cordova by [Ionic Framework](ionicframework.com). It supports most, but not all Cordova plugins, as well as Capacitor-specific plugins. It exposes native device APIs in the form of JavaScript modules.

:::warning
Capacitor support in Quasar CLI is currently experimental. Things may break, and you should not use this in a production environment. If you find any issues, please report them on the [Quasar Github Repo](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar).
