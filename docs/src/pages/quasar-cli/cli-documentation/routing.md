desc: How to use the Vue Router in a Quasar app.
---

You'll notice that your Quasar project contains a `/src/router` folder. This holds the routing configuration of your website/app:
* "/src/router/index.js" holds the Vue Router initialization code
* "/src/router/routes.js" holds the routes of your website/app

Make sure to read [Vue Router documentation](https://router.vuejs.org/) to understand how it works.

The `/src/router/routes.js` needs to import your website/app's Pages and Layouts. Read more on [Routing with Layouts and Pages](/layout/routing-with-layouts-and-pages) documentation page.
