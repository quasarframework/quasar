## Read & Write Local Files
One great benefit of using Tauri is the ability to access the user's file system. This enables you to read and write files on the local system.

We can use the userData directory, which is reserved specifically for our application, so we can have confidence other programs or other user interactions should not tamper with this file space.

## Running Node in Tauri?
Do you really need a node server? Well, in theory you could ship a full-fledged node server as part of your dist, but you should really ask yourself if this is entirely necessary.
