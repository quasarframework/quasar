title: Configuring Electron
---
We'll be using Quasar CLI to develop and build an Electron App. The difference between building a SPA, PWA, Mobile App or an Electron App is simply determined by the "mode" parameter in "quasar dev" and "quasar build" commands.

But first, let's learn how we can configure the Electron build.

## Quasar.conf.js
You may notice that `/quasar.conf.js` contains a property called `electron`.
```js
electron: {
  // optional; webpack config Object for
  // the Main Process ONLY (/src-electron/main-process/)
  extendWebpack (cfg) {
    // directly change props of cfg;
    // no need to return anything
  },

  // optional; EQUIVALENT to extendWebpack() but uses webpack-chain;
  // for the Main Process ONLY (/src-electron/main-process/)
  chainWebpack (chain) {
    // chain is a webpack-chain instance
    // of the Webpack configuration
  },

  bundler: 'packager', // or 'builder'

  // electron-packager options
  packager: {
    //...
  },

  // electron-builder options
  builder: {
    //...
  }
}
```

The "packager" prop refers to [electron-packager options](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager/blob/master/docs/api.md#options). The `dir` and `out` properties are overwritten by Quasar CLI to ensure the best results.

The "builder" prop refers to [electron-builder options](https://www.electron.build/configuration/configuration).
