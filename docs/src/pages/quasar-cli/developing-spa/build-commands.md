[Quasar CLI](/start/quasar-cli) makes it incredibly simple to develop or build the final distributables from your source code.

Developing:
```bash
$ quasar dev
```

Building for Production:
```bash
$ quasar build
```

If you want a production build with debugging enabled:

```bash
$ quasar build -d

# ..or the longer form
$ quasar build --debug
```
