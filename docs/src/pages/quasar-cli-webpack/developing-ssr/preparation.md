We’ll be using Quasar CLI to develop and build a SSR website. The difference between building a SPA, Mobile App, Electron App, PWA or SSR is simply determined by the “mode” parameter in “quasar dev” and “quasar build” commands.

In order to develop or build a SSR website, we first need to add the SSR mode to our Quasar project:

```bash
$ quasar mode add ssr
```

If you want to jump right in and start developing, you can skip the "quasar mode" command and issue:

```bash
$ quasar dev -m ssr
```

This will add SSR mode automatically, if it is missing.

A new folder will appear in your project folder (which is explained in detail on the [Configuring SSR](/quasar-cli-webpack/developing-ssr/configuring-ssr) page):

<doc-tree :def="scope.tree" />
