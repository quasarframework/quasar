Quasar Cards are a great way to display important pieces of grouped content, and are quickly emerging as a core design pattern for Apps. Theyâ€™re a great way to contain and organize information, while also setting up predictable expectations for the user. With so much content to display at once, and often so little screen real-estate, Cards have fast become the design pattern of choice for many companies, including the likes of Google and Twitter.

Experiment with different Web Components by embedding them in Card components to create awesome results.
