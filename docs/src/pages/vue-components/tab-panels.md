Tab panels are a way of displaying more information using less window real estate.

::: tip
Works great along with [QTabs](/vue-components/tabs) but it is not required to be used with it.
:::

## Installation
<doc-installation :components="['QTabPanels', 'QTabPanel']" />

## Usage

::: tip
Works great along with [QTabs](/vue-components/tabs), a component which offers a nice way to select the active tab panel to display.
:::

::: warning IMPORTANT
Do not be mistaken by the "QTabPanels" component name. Panels do not require QTabs. They can be used as standalone too.
:::

::: danger
Please take notice of the Boolean `keep-alive` prop for QTabPanels, if you need this behavior. Do NOT use Vue's native `<keep-alive>` component over QTabPanel.

### Basic

### With QTabs

::: tip
QTabPanels can be used as standalone too. They do not depend on the presence of a QTabs. Also, they can be placed anywhere within a page, not just near QTabs.
