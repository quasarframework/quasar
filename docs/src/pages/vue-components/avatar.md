The QAvatar component creates a scalable, color-able element that can have text, icon or image within its shape. By default it is circular, but it can also be square or have a border-radius applied to give rounded corners to the square shape.

It is often used with other components in their slots.

## Usage

::: tip
The `size` property will determine the height and the width of the Avatar. The `font-size` property will set the size of the font used within the Avatar, which will have an effect on the size of letters and icons.
