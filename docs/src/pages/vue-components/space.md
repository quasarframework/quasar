The purpose of QSpace (has no props) is to simply fill all available space inside of a flexbox DOM element.

As a sidenote, all Quasar components use flexbox. So what this means, for example (there are numerous examples, just mentioning one), is that you can use QSpace in a QToolbar.

## Usage
These are only two examples so you can get a glimpse on how to use it.
