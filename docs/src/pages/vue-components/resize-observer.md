QResizeObserver is a Quasar component that emits a `resize` event whenever the wrapping DOM element / component (defined as direct parent of QResizeObserver) changes its size (width and/or height). Note that no polling is involved, but overusing it is costly too.


## QResizeObserver API

## Usage

<doc-example title="Basic" file="QResizeObserver/Basic" />

Please note that QResizeObserver will issue an event as soon as it gets rendered and attached to DOM, so you can have the initial size of the container.
