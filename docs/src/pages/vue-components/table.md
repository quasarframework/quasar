QTable is a component that allows you to display data in a tabular manner. It's generally called a datatable. It packs the following main features:
  * Filtering
  * Sorting
  * Single / Multiple rows selection with custom selection actions
  * Pagination (including server-side if required)
  * Grid mode (you can use for example QCards to display data in a non-tabular manner)
  * Total customization of rows and cells through scoped slots
  * Ability to add additional row(s) at top or bottom of data rows
  * Column picker (through QTableColumns component described in one of the sections)
  * Custom top and/or bottom Table controls
  * Responsive design

::: tip
If you don't need pagination, sorting, filtering, and all other features of QTable, then you may want to check out [QMarkupTable](/vue-components/markup-table) component instead.

## Installation
<doc-installation :components="['QTable', 'QTh', 'QTr', 'QTd']" />

## Defining the columns

Let’s take an example of configuring the `columns` property. We are going to tell QTable that `row-key` is ‘name’, which **must** be unique. If this was data fetched from a database we would likely use the row **id**.

```js
columns: [ // array of Objects
  // column Object definition
  {
    // unique id
    // identifies column
    // (used by pagination.sortBy, "body-cell-[name]" slot, ...)
    name: 'desc',

    // label for header
    label: 'Dessert (100g serving)',

    // row Object property to determine value for this column
    field: 'name',
    // OR field: row => row.some.nested.prop,

    // (optional) if we use visible-columns, this col will always be visible
    required: true,

    // (optional) alignment
    align: 'left',

    // (optional) tell QTable you want this column sortable
    sortable: true,

    // (optional) compare function if you have
    // some custom data or want a specific way to compare two rows
    sort: (a, b, rowA, rowB) => parseInt(a, 10) - parseInt(b, 10),
    // function return value:
    //   * is less than 0 then sort a to an index lower than b, i.e. a comes first
    //   * is 0 then leave a and b unchanged with respect to each other, but sorted with respect to all different elements
    //   * is greater than 0 then sort b to an index lower than a, i.e. b comes first

    // (optional) you can format the data with a function
    format: (val, row) => `${val}%`,
    // one more format example:
    // format: val => val
    //   ? /* Unicode checkmark checked */ "\u2611"
    //   : /* Unicode checkmark unchecked */ "\u2610",

    // body td:
    style: 'width: 500px',
    classes: 'my-special-class',

    // (v1.3+) header th:
    headerStyle: 'width: 500px',
    headerClasses: 'my-special-class'
  },
  { name: 'calories', label: 'Calories', field: 'calories', sortable: true },
  { name: 'fat', label: 'Fat (g)', field: 'fat', sortable: true },
  { name: 'carbs', label: 'Carbs (g)', field: 'carbs' },
  { name: 'protein', label: 'Protein (g)', field: 'protein' },
  { name: 'sodium', label: 'Sodium (mg)', field: 'sodium' },
  { name: 'calcium', label: 'Calcium (%)', field: 'calcium', sortable: true, sort: (a, b) => parseInt(a, 10) - parseInt(b, 10) },
  { name: 'iron', label: 'Iron (%)', field: 'iron', sortable: true, sort: (a, b) => parseInt(a, 10) - parseInt(b, 10) }
]
```

## Basic usage

<doc-example title="Basic" file="QTable/Basic" />

<doc-example title="Dark" file="QTable/Dark" />

<doc-example title="Dense" file="QTable/Dense" />

::: tip
You can use the `dense` prop along with `$q.screen` to create a responsive behavior. Example: `:dense="$q.screen.lt.md"`. More info: [Screen Plugin](/options/screen-plugin).
:::

## Omitting columns definition <q-badge align="top" label="v1.12+" />

You can omit specifying the `columns`. QTable will infer the columns from the properties of the first row of the data. Note that labels are uppercased and sorting is enabled:

<doc-example title="Infering columns from data" file="QTable/InferColumns" />

## Sticky header/column

::: warning
Sticky headers and columns are achieved through CSS with `position: sticky`. This is NOT supported on all browsers. Check [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/#search=sticky) before using this technique.
:::

<doc-example title="Sticky header" file="QTable/StickyHeader" />

<doc-example title="Sticky column" file="QTable/StickyColumn" />

<doc-example title="Sticky header and column" file="QTable/StickyHeaderAndColumn" />

## Separators

<doc-example title="Separators" file="QTable/Separators" />

## Styling

<doc-example title="Custom column" file="QTable/CustomColumn" />

<doc-example title="Custom coloring" file="QTable/CustomColor" />

<doc-example title="No header/footer" file="QTable/NoHeaderFooter" />

## Virtual scrolling <q-badge align="top" label="v1.2+" />

Notice that when enabling virtual scroll you will need to specify the `table-style` (with a max-height) prop. In the example below, we are also forcing QTable to display all rows at once (note the use of `pagination` and `rows-per-page-options` props).

<doc-example title="Basic virtual scroll" file="QTable/VirtscrollBasic" />

You can dynamically load new rows when scroll reaches the end:

<doc-example title="Dynamic loading virtual scroll" file="QTable/VirtscrollDynamic" />

You can have both virtual scroll and pagination:

<doc-example title="Virtual scroll and pagination" file="QTable/VirtscrollPagination" />

The example below shows how virtual scroll can be used along with a sticky header. Notice the `virtual-scroll-sticky-start` prop which is set to the header height. Also note that this will NOT work in IE11 due to the lack of support for CSS prop "position" with value "sticky".

<doc-example title="Virtual scroll with sticky header" file="QTable/VirtscrollSticky" />

Starting with v1.8.4, there are 2 utility CSS classes that control VirtualScroll size calculation:
* Use `q-virtual-scroll--with-prev` class on an element rendered by the VirtualScroll to indicate that the element should be grouped with the previous one (main use case is for multiple table rows generated from the same row of data).
* Use `q-virtual-scroll--skip` class on an element rendered by the VirtualScroll to indicate that the element's size should be ignored in size calculations.

<doc-example title="Virtual scroll with multiple rows for a data row" file="QTable/VirtscrollMultipleRows" />

## Selection

::: warning
The property `row-key` must be set in order for selection to work properly.
:::

<doc-example title="Single selection" file="QTable/SingleSelection" />

<doc-example title="Multiple selection" file="QTable/MultipleSelection" />

<doc-example title="Selection cell slots (v1.14+)" file="QTable/SelectionSlots" />

<doc-example title="Custom multiple selection" file="QTable/CustomSelection" />

## Visible columns, custom top, fullscreen

Please note that columns marked as `required` (in the column definition) cannot be toggled and are always visible.

<doc-example title="Visible columns, custom top and fullscreen" file="QTable/VisibleColumns" />

<doc-example title="Visible columns" file="QTable/VisibleColumns2" />

## Popup editing

::: tip
Below is an example with the user being able to edit “in place” with the help of **QPopupEdit** component. Please note that we are using the `body` scoped slot. **QPopupEdit** won’t work with cell scoped slots.
:::

<doc-example title="Popup editing" file="QTable/PopupEditing" />

## Grid style

::: tip
You can use the `grid` prop along with `$q.screen` to create a responsive behavior. Example: `:grid="$q.screen.lt.md"`. More info: [Screen Plugin](/options/screen-plugin).
:::

In the example below, we let QTable deal with displaying the grid mode (not using the specific slot):

<doc-example title="Grid style" file="QTable/GridStyle" />

<doc-example title="Grid with header" file="QTable/GridHeader" />

<doc-example title="Colored grid style" file="QTable/GridStyleColored" />

<doc-example title="Masonry like grid" file="QTable/GridMasonry" />

However, if you want to fully customize the content, check the example below, where:
  * We are using a Vue scoped slot called `item` to define how each record (the equivalent of a row in non-grid mode) should look. This allows you total freedom.
  * We are using multiple selection.

<doc-example title="Grid style with slot" file="QTable/GridStyleSlot" />

## Expanding rows

::: warning
Add unique (distinct) `key` on QTr if you generate more than one QTr from a row in data.
:::

<doc-example title="Internal expansion model" file="QTable/ExpandedRowInternal" />

Starting with v1.8.3, an external expansion model can also be used:

<doc-example title="External expansion model" file="QTable/ExpandedRowExternal" />

If you are using virtual scroll with QTable, you should know that starting with v1.8.4 there are 2 utility CSS classes that control VirtualScroll size calculation:
* Use `q-virtual-scroll--with-prev` class on an element rendered by the VirtualScroll to indicate that the element should be grouped with the previous one (main use case is for multiple table rows generated from the same row of data).
* Use `q-virtual-scroll--skip` class on an element rendered by the VirtualScroll to indicate that the element's size should be ignored in size calculations.

<doc-example title="Virtual scroll with expansion model" file="QTable/VirtscrollExpandedRow" />

## Before/after slots

<doc-example title="Before/After slots (header/footer)" file="QTable/BeforeAfterHeaderFooter" />

## Pagination <q-badge align="top" label="enhanced on v1.12+" />

::: warning
On Quasar <= v1.11, the `pagination` prop usage required the ".sync" modifier. With v1.12+ this is not longer mandatory, but if you want to control the Table’s pagination from your own components, then it is still a must-do. Example: `pagination.sync="pagination"`.
:::

::: tip
When `pagination` has a property named `rowsNumber`, then this means that you’ll be configuring Table for **server**-side pagination (& sorting & filtering). See *"Server side pagination, filter and sorting"* section.
:::

Below are two examples of handling the pagination (and sorting and rows per page).

The first example highlights how to configure the initial pagination:

<doc-example title="Initial pagination" file="QTable/PaginationInitial" />

The second example uses the ".sync" modifier because we want to access its current value at any time. A use-case for the technique below can be to control the pagination from outside of QTable.

<doc-example title="Synchronized pagination" file="QTable/PaginationSync" />

## Pagination slot

For learning purposes, we will customize the pagination controls with the default controls in order to help you get started with your own.

<doc-example title="Pagination slot" file="QTable/PaginationSlot" />

## Loading state

<doc-example title="Default loading" file="QTable/Loading" />

The example below requires Quasar v1.8+:

<doc-example title="Custom loading state" file="QTable/CustomLoading" />

## Custom top

<doc-example title="Custom top with add/remove row" file="QTable/CustomTop" />

## Body slots

The example below shows how you can use a slot to customize the entire row:

<doc-example title="Body slot" file="QTable/SlotBody" />

Below, we use a slot which gets applied to each body cell:

<doc-example title="Body-cell slot" file="QTable/SlotBodyCell" />

We can also customize only one particular column only. The syntax for this slot is `body-cell-[name]`, where `[name]` should be replaced by the property of each row which is used as the row-key.

<doc-example title="Body-cell-[name] slot" file="QTable/SlotBodyCellName" />

## Header slots

The example below shows how you can use a slot to customize the entire header row:

<doc-example title="Header slot" file="QTable/SlotHeader" />

Bellow, we use a slot which gets applied to each header cell:

<doc-example title="Header-cell slot" file="QTable/SlotHeaderCell" />

Starting with **v1.1.1+**, we can also customize only one particular header cell only. The syntax for this slot is `header-cell-[name]`, where `[name]` should be replaced by the property of each row which is used as the row-key.

<doc-example title="Header-cell-[name] slot" file="QTable/SlotHeaderCellName" />

## No data

<doc-example title="No Data Label" file="QTable/NoData" />

Starting with **v1.1.1+**, there is also a "no-data" scoped slot (see below) that you can also to customize the messages for both when a filter doesn't returns any results or the table has no data to display. Also type something into the "Search" input.

<doc-example title="No Data Slot" file="QTable/NoDataSlot" />

## Handling bottom layer <q-badge align="top" label="v1.12+" />

There are a few properties that you can use to hide the bottom layer or specific parts of it. You can play with it below:

<doc-example title="Hiding bottom layer" file="QTable/HideBottom" />

## Custom sorting

<doc-example title="Custom sorting" file="QTable/CustomSorting" />

## Responsive tables

In order to create responsive tables, we have two tools at our disposal: `dense` and `grid` properties. We can connect these with `$q.screen`. More info: [Screen Plugin](/options/screen-plugin).

First example below uses `$q.screen.lt.md` (for enabling dense mode) and the second examples uses `$q.screen.xs` to enable grid mode, so play with browser width to see them in action.

<doc-example title="Using dense prop" file="QTable/ResponsiveDense" />

<doc-example title="Using grid prop" file="QTable/ResponsiveGrid" />

The example above is essentially mimicking the earlier Quasar versions of the table behavior.

## Server side pagination, filter and sorting

When your database contains a big number of rows for a Table, obviously it’s not feasible to load them all for multiple reasons (memory, UI rendering performance, …). Instead, you can load only a Table page. Whenever the user wants to navigate to another Table page, or wants to sort by a column or wants to filter the Table, a **request** is sent to the **server** to fetch the partially paged data.

1. First step to enable this behavior is to specify `pagination` prop, which MUST contain `rowsNumber`. QTable needs to know the total number of rows available in order to correctly render the pagination links. Should filtering cause the `rowsNumber` to change then it must be modified dynamically.

2. Second step is to listen for `@request` event on QTable. This event is triggered when data needs to be fetched from the **server** because either page number or sorting or filtering changed.

3. It’s best that you also specify the `loading` prop in order to notify the user that a background process is in progress.

::: tip
In the example below, steps have been taken to emulate an ajax call to a server. While the concepts are similar, if you use this code you will need to make the appropriate changes to connect to your own data source.
:::

<doc-example title="Synchronizing with server" file="QTable/Synchronizing" />

## Exporting data

Below is an example of a naive csv encoding and then exporting table data by using the [exportFile](/quasar-utils/other-utils#Export-file) Quasar util. The browser should trigger a file download. For a more professional approach in regards to encoding we do recommend using [csv-parse](https://csv.js.org/parse/) and [csv-stringify](https://csv.js.org/stringify/) packages.

::: tip
You could also make use of the `filteredSortedRows` internal computed property of QTable should you want to export the user filtered + sorted data.
:::

<doc-example title="Export to csv" file="QTable/ExportCsv" />

## Keyboard navigation

Below is an example of keyboard navigation in the table using selected row. Use `ArrowUp`, `ArrowDown`, `PageUp`, `PageDown`, `Home` and `End` keys to navigate.
