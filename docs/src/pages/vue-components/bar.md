The QBar is a small component for creating the top bar on different types of mobile or desktop websites/apps. For instance, in desktop apps QBar will have things like the close, minimize or maximize buttons and other menu controls for your application.

QBar is especially useful for frame-less Electron apps where you integrate it in the QHeader.

For responsiveness, use [Visibility](/style/visibility#Window-Width-Related) Quasar CSS Classes. For finer tuning you can go write your own CSS media breakpoints or even go with [QResizeObserver](/vue-components/resize-observer).
