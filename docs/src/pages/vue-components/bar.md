QBar is a small component for creating the top bar on different types of mobile or desktop apps. For instance, in desktop apps QBar will have things like the close, minimize or maximize buttons and other menu controls for your application. For mobile apps, it's a place holder for the StatusBar overlay of Cordova and will show things like battery level, wifi symbol, cell network, etc.

QBar can also be used as the header for Dialogs.
