title: Carousel
desc: The QCarousel Vue component allows you to display a series of slides, useful for wizards or an image gallery.
---

The QCarousel component allows you to display more information with less real estate, using slides. Useful for creating Wizards or an image gallery too.

## Installation
<doc-installation :components="['QCarousel', 'QCarouselControl', 'QCarouselSlide']" />

## Usage

::: tip
If the QCarouselSlide content also has images and you want to use swipe actions to navigate, you might want to add `draggable="false"` to them, otherwise the native browser behavior might interfere in a negative way.
:::

::: danger
Please take notice of the Boolean `keep-alive` prop for QCarousel, if you need this behavior. Do NOT use Vue's native `<keep-alive>` component over QCarouselSlide.

### Basic

Below is an almost stripped down basic Carousel (it is just animated and only has custom transitions specified) with no navigation embedded. For this reason, we are controlling the current slide through the model.

<doc-example title="Basic" file="QCarousel/Basic" />

### Transitions

In the example below:
* There are just a few transitions demoed. For a complete list of transitions, head to the [Transitions](/options/transitions) page.
* You can also swipe with your finger (or swiping with the mouse -- clicking and quickly dragging to left/right then releasing).

<doc-example title="Transitions, bottom navigation, arrows and auto padding" file="QCarousel/Transitions" />

### Vertical <q-badge align="top" label="v1.9+" />

<doc-example title="Vertical mode" file="QCarousel/Vertical" />

### Control type <q-badge align="top" label="v1.9+" />

The notion of "control" here refers to the arrows and navigation buttons. Since they are buttons, you can also pick their type to better match your design. You also benefit from the `control-color` and `control-text-color` props.

<doc-example title="Control Type" file="QCarousel/ControlType" />

### Navigation position <q-badge align="top" label="v1.9+" />

<doc-example title="Navigation position" file="QCarousel/NavigationPosition" />

### Custom navigation <q-badge align="top" label="v1.13.2+" />

For a full list of properties of the `navigation-icon` slot, please consult the API card.

<doc-example title="Custom navigation" file="QCarousel/CustomNavigation" />

### Auto padding

Below is an example with which you can play with different QCarousel settings so you can see the padding (or lack of) in action:

<doc-example title="Padding" file="QCarousel/AutoPadding" />

### Media content

<doc-example title="Image slides" file="QCarousel/ImageSlides" />

<doc-example title="Multi-image slides" file="QCarousel/MultiImageSlides" />

<doc-example title="Captions" file="QCarousel/Captions" />

<doc-example title="Video slides" file="QCarousel/VideoSlides" />

In the example below there are thumbnails being generated automatically. Thumbnails only applies to image slides.

<doc-example title="Thumbnails" file="QCarousel/Thumbnails" />

::: tip
Don't use the property `navigation` along with `thumbnails` as the first supercedes the latter so the thumbnails will not be displayed.
:::

### Infinite and autoplay

You can pause autoplay when the pointer is over the carousel or over a region of interest.

<doc-example title="Autoplay" file="QCarousel/InfiniteAutoplay" />

### Controls

<doc-example title="Controls" file="QCarousel/Controls" />

### With QScrollArea <q-badge align="top" label="v1.9+" />

Please note how [QScrollArea](/vue-components/scroll-area) is used in the two examples below. Also note the `q-carousel--padding` CSS helper class in the second example.

<doc-example title="With QScrollArea and padding" file="QCarousel/WithScrollareaPadding" />

<doc-example title="With QScrollArea on whole slide" file="QCarousel/WithScrollareaFull" />

### Fullscreen

<doc-example title="Fullscreen" file="QCarousel/Fullscreen" />
