The QDialog component is a great way to offer the user the ability to choose a specific action or list of actions. They also can provide the user with important information, or require them to make a decision (or multiple decisions).

From a UI perspective, you can think of Dialogs as a type of floating modal, which covers only a portion of the screen. This means Dialogs should only be used for quick user actions, like verifying a password, getting a short App notification or selecting an option or options quickly.

::: tip
Dialogs can also be used as a globally available method for more basic use cases, like the native JS alert(), prompt(), etc. For the latter behaviour, go to [Dialog Plugin](/quasar-plugins/dialog) page.

::: tip
When the user hits the phone/tablet back button (only for Cordova apps), the Dialog will be closed automatically. Also, when on a desktop browser, hitting the `ESCAPE` key will also close the Dialog, as does clicking or touching outside of the Dialog, unless configured otherwise.

## Installation
<doc-installation components="QDialog" directives="ClosePopup" />

## Usage

::: warning Note
It's best that your QDialog main content is a QCard. However, if you are planning on using any other component (like QForm) or tag, make sure that the direct child of QDialog is rendered with a `<div>` tag (or wrap it with one yourself).

### Basic

<doc-example title="Basic" file="QDialog/Basic" />

### Styling

<doc-example title="Styling" file="QDialog/Style" />

### Positioning
<doc-example title="Positions" file="QDialog/Positioning" />

::: tip
Do not mistake "position" prop with the show/hide animation. If you want a custom animation, you should use `transition-show` and `transition-hide` which can be applied regardless of "position" or "maximized".
:::

<doc-example title="Maximized" file="QDialog/Maximized" />

### Various content
Dialogs can contain any content. Some examples:

<doc-example title="Various content" file="QDialog/VariousContent" />

<doc-example title="With containerized QLayout" file="QDialog/Layout" />

::: tip
If you are going to use the containerized QLayout, you'll need to put a width on your QDialog, if using left/right position, or a height, if using top/bottom position. You can use vw and vh units.
:::

### Handling scroll
<doc-example title="Scrollable dialogs" file="QDialog/Scrollable" />

### Different modes
User cannot dismiss the Dialog by pressing ESCAPE key or by clicking/tapping on its backdrop.

<doc-example title="Persistent" file="QDialog/Persistent" />

Dialogs can also be a part of the page, without requiring immediate focus. It's where "seamless" mode comes into play:

<doc-example title="Seamless" file="QDialog/Seamless" />

### Dialog in dialog
You are able to open dialogs on top of other dialogs, with infinite number of depth levels.

<doc-example title="Inception" file="QDialog/Inception" />

### Sizing
You are able to customize the size of the Dialogs. Notice we either tamper with the content's style or we use `full-width` or `full-height` props:
