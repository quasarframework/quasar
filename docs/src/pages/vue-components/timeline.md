A Timeline is a display of a list of events in chronological order. It is typically a graphic design showing a long bar labelled with dates alongside itself and usually events. Timelines can use any time scale, depending on the subject and data.

QTimeline has 3 media breakpoints (if `responsive` property is used). View on a desktop and click the "View Desktop" link on the right side, then resize the browser window to see the media breakpoints in action.
