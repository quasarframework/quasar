## QTooltip API

<doc-api file="QTooltip" />

## Usage
The idea with QTooltip is to place it inside your DOM element / component that you want to be the trigger as direct child. Donâ€™t worry about QTooltip content inheriting CSS from the container as the QTooltip will be injected as a direct child of `<body>` through a Quasar Portal.

<doc-example title="Toggle through v-model" file="QTooltip/VModel" />

### Customize

<doc-example title="With offset" file="QTooltip/Offset" />

### Transitions

In the example below there's a few transitions showcased. For a full list of transitions available, go to [Transitions](/options/transitions).

### Reusable

The example below shows how to create a re-usable menu that can be shared with different targets.

<doc-example title="Using target" file="QTooltip/Target" />

### Positioning
The position of QTooltip can be customized. It keeps account of the `anchor` and `self` optional props.
The final position of QTooltip popup is calculated so that it will be displayed on the available screen real estate, switching to the right-side and/or top-side when necessary.

For horizontal positioning you can use `start` and `end` when you want to automatically take into account if on RTL or non-RTL. `start` and `end` mean "left" for non-RTL and "right" for RTL.
