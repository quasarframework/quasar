Quasar Tree represents a highly configurable component that displays hierarchical data, such as a table of contents in a tree structure.

## QTree API

<doc-api file="QTree" />

## Usage

### Basic

<doc-example title="Basic" file="QTree/Basic" />

### No connector lines

<doc-example title="No connectors" file="QTree/NoConnectors" />

### Dark

<doc-example title="Dark" file="QTree/Dark" dark />

### Integrated example

<doc-example title="With QSplitter and QTabPanels" file="QTree/Splitter" />

More info: [QSplitter](/vue-components/splitter), [QTabPanels](/vue-components/tab-panels).

### Customize content

Notice (in the example below) the default header and body slot customization.

<doc-example title="Default header and body slots" file="QTree/SlotsDefault" />

Notice (in the example below) the custom header and body slots.

<doc-example title="Customizing nodes" file="QTree/SlotsCustomized" />

::: warning
Clicking or pressing `SPACE` or `ENTER` on the custom header selects the tree item (and the custom header is blurred).

If you don't want this to happen just wrap the content of the custom header in a `<div @click.stop @keypress.stop>` (or add the listeners to the respective component/element that is emitting them).

### Accordion, filtering and selectable

In the example below, sibling nodes get contracted when one gets expanded.

<doc-example title="Accordion mode" file="QTree/Accordion" />

<doc-example title="Filtering nodes" file="QTree/FilterDefault" />

<doc-example title="Selectable nodes" file="QTree/Selectable" />

### Lazy loading

<doc-example title="Lazy loading nodes" file="QTree/LazyLoad" />

### Selection vs ticking, expansion

* Selection (through QTree `selected` prop) refers to the currently selected node (gets highlighted with different background).
* Ticking (through QTree `ticked` prop) refers to the checkbox associated with each node.
* Expansion (through QTree `expanded` prop) refers to the nodes that are expanded.

All properties above require to be dynamically bound using `v-model:<prop_name>` directive in order for them to work correctly (example: `v-model:expanded`).

<doc-example title="Syncing node properties" file="QTree/Sync" />

### Tick strategy

There are three ticking strategy: 'leaf', 'leaf-filtered', 'strict' with an additional (and default) 'none' which disables ticking.

| Strategy | Description |
| --- | --- |
| leaf | Ticked nodes are only the leaves. Ticking a node influences the parent's ticked state too (parent becomes partially ticked or ticked), as well as its children (all tickable children become ticked). |
| leaf-filtered | Same concept as `leaf`, only that this strategy applies only to filtered nodes (the nodes that remain visible after filtering). |
| strict | Ticked nodes are independent of parent or children tick state. |

You can apply a global tick strategy for a QTree and locally change the ticking strategy for a certain node by specifying the `tickStrategy` in the `nodes` model.

<doc-example title="Tick strategy" file="QTree/TickStrategy" />

### Custom filter method
You can customize the filtering method by specifying the `filter-method` prop. The method below filters by input if it also has '(*)':

<doc-example title="Custom filter" file="QTree/FilterCustom" />

### Nodes model structure
The following describes a node's properties that are taken into account by QTree's v-model.

| Node Property | Type | Behavior when not present | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| \<nodeKey\> | String, Number | An error is generated | Node's key. The key is picked from the key specified in `nodeKey` property. |
| label | String | The item has no label | Node's label. When `labelKey` prop is set the label is picked from that key. |
| icon | String | The default icon is used | Node's icon. |
| iconColor | String | The inherited color is used | Node's icon color. One from Quasar Color Palette. |
| img | String | No image is displayed | Node's image. Use /public folder. Example: 'mountains.png' |
| avatar | String | No avatar is displayed | Node's avatar. Use /public folder. Example: 'boy-avatar.png' |
| children | Array | This node has no sub-nodes | Array of nodes as children. |
| disabled | Boolean | The node is enabled | Is node disabled? |
| expandable | Boolean | The node is expandable | Is node expandable? |
| selectable | Boolean | The node is selectable | Is node selectable? |
| handler | Function | No extra function is called | Custom function that should be called on click on node. Receives `node` as parameter. |
| tickable | Boolean | The node is tickable according to tick strategy | When using a tick strategy, each node shows a checkbox. Should a node's checkbox be disabled? |
| noTick | Boolean | Node displays a checkbox | When using a tick strategy, should node display a checkbox? |
| tickStrategy | String | Tick strategy 'none' is used | Override global tick strategy for this node only. One of 'leaf', 'leaf-filtered', 'strict', 'none'. |
| lazy | Boolean | Children are not lazy loaded | Should children be lazy loaded? In this case also don't specify 'children' prop. |
| header | String | Slot 'default-header' is used | Node header scoped slot name, without the required 'header-' prefix. Example: 'story' refers to 'header-story' scoped slot. |
| body | String | Slot 'default-body' is used | Node body scoped slot name, without the required 'body-' prefix. Example: 'story' refers to 'body-story' scoped slot. |
