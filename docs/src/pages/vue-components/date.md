The QDate component provides a method to input date. Currently it supports Gregorian (default) and Persian calendars.

::: tip
For handling date and/or time, also check out [Quasar Date Utils](/quasar-utils/date-utils).
:::

<DocApi file="QDate" />

## Usage

::: warning
Notice that the actual date(s) of the model are all in String format.
:::

### Basic

<DocExample title="Basic" file="Basic" overflow />

::: tip
For landscape mode, you can use it along with `$q.screen` to make QDate responsive. Example: `:landscape="$q.screen.gt.xs"`. More info: [Quasar Screen Plugin](/options/screen-plugin).
:::

<DocExample title="Landscape" file="Landscape" overflow />

### Multiple selection

Notice below that the model is an Array and we specify the "multiple" prop.

Clicking on an already selected day will deselect it.

<DocExample title="Multiple days" file="SelectionMultiple" overflow />

### Range selection

Notice in the examples below that the model is an Object (single selection) or an Array of Objects (multiple selection).

::: tip TIPS
* Clicking on an already selected day will deselect it.
* The user's current editing range can also be set programmatic through the `setEditingRange` method (check the API card).
* There are two useful events in regards to the current editing range: `range-start` and `range-end` (check the API card).
:::

::: warning
The `range` property is only partially compatible with the `options` prop: selected ranges might also include "unselectable" days.
:::

<DocExample title="Single Range" file="SelectionRange" overflow />

<DocExample title="Multiple ranges" file="SelectionRangeMultiple" overflow />

### Custom title and subtitle

When not in 'minimal' mode, QDate has a computed header title and subtitle. You can override it, like in the example below.

When clicking on title then the QDate's view is changed to the calendar and when clicking on subtitle, the view will switch to year picking.

<DocExample title="Custom title and subtitle" file="CustomTitleSubtitle" overflow />

### Functionality

When model is unfilled (like `null`, `void 0` / `undefined`) QDate still has to show the calendar for a month of a year. You can use `default-year-month` prop for this, otherwise the current month of the year will be shown:

<DocExample title="Default year month" file="DefaultYearMonth" overflow />

The default view can be changed.

<DocExample title="Default view" file="DefaultView" overflow />

The first day of the week is applied depending on the [Quasar Language Pack](/options/quasar-language-packs) that you've set, but you can also force it, like in the example below.

<DocExample title="First day of week" file="FirstDayOfWeek" overflow />

Clicking on the "Today" button sets date to current user date. Requires the header, so you can't use it along with "minimal" mode:

<DocExample title="Today button" file="TodayBtn" overflow />

<DocExample title="Disable and readonly" file="DisableReadonly" overflow />

### Model mask

The default model mask is `YYYY/MM/DD`, however you can use custom ones too.

The `mask` prop tokens can be found at [Quasar Utils > Date utils](/quasar-utils/date-utils#format-for-display).

::: warning Note on SSR
Using `x` or `X` (timestamps) in the mask may cause hydration errors on the client, because decoding the model String must be done with `new Date()` which takes into account the local timezone. As a result, if the server is in a different timezone than the client, then the rendered output of the server will differ than the one on the client so hydration will fail.
:::

::: danger Note on persian calendar
When using the persian calendar, the mask for QDate is forced to `YYYY/MM/DD`.
:::

<DocExample title="Simple mask" file="MaskSimple" overflow />

If you want to insert strings (including `[` and `]` characters) into your mask, make sure you escape them by surrounding them with `[` and `]`, otherwise the characters might be interpreted as format tokens.

<DocExample title="Mask with escaped characters" file="MaskEscape" overflow />

Using the mask to connect a QDate and [QTime](/vue-components/time) to the same model:

<DocExample title="QDate and QTime on same model" file="MaskDateTime" overflow />

::: tip
If you want to programmatically set the value of QDate, you can do so by just re-assigning the value that you pass. However, the updated value needs to be a string in the same format as your mask. Eg. in the case your mask is `'dddd, MMM D, YYYY'`, passing `'2019/04/28'` as value won't work, you would need to pass `'Sunday, Apr 28, 2019'` instead.
:::

### Custom ad-hoc locale

If, for some reason, you need to use a custom ad-hoc locale rather than the current Quasar Language Pack that has been set, you can use the `locale` prop:

<DocExample title="Custom ad-hoc locale" file="CustomLocale" overflow />

### Coloring

<DocExample title="Coloring" file="Color" overflow />

<DocExample title="Force dark mode" file="Dark" overflow />

### Highlighting events

The first example is using an array and the second example is using a function.

<DocExample title="Events" file="Events" overflow />

<DocExample title="Event color" file="EventColor" overflow />

### Limiting options

* You can use the `options` prop to limit user selection to certain times.
* Alternatively, for a more in-depth way of limiting options, you can also supply a function (second and third example below) to `options-fn` prop.

::: warning
The `options` property is only partially compatible with the `range` prop. Ranges might contain "unselectable" days.
:::

<DocExample title="Options" file="Options" overflow />

### Applying navigation boundaries

In the example below the navigation is restricted between 2020/07 and 2020/09.

<DocExample title="Navigation boundaries" file="NavigationBoundaries" overflow />

### With additional buttons

You can use the default slot for adding buttons:

<DocExample title="With additional buttons" file="AdditionalButtons" overflow />

### With QSplitter and QTabPanels

<DocExample title="With QSplitter and QTabPanels" file="Splitter" />

More info: [QSplitter](/vue-components/splitter), [QTabPanels](/vue-components/tab-panels).

### With QInput

<DocExample title="With QInput" file="Input" />

Connecting a QDate and QTime with same model on a QInput:

<DocExample title="QDate and QTime with QInput" file="InputFull" overflow />

The following are **helpers** for QInput `mask` and `rules` props. You can use these for convenience or write the string specifying your [custom needs](/vue-components/input#mask).

* Property `mask` helpers: [full list](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/blob/dev/ui/src/components/input/use-mask.js#L6).
* Property `rules` helpers: [full list](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/blob/dev/ui/src/utils/patterns/patterns.js).

Examples: "date", "time", "fulltime".

More info: [QInput](/vue-components/input).

### Persian calendar

You have to set `calendar` to `persian` to use this feature .

::: tip
You can couple this with a Quasar [language pack](/options/quasar-language-packs) such as Persian (Farsi, `fa-IR`) to have the QDate strings translated too, for the full experience.
:::

::: warning
When using the persian calendar, the mask for QDate is forced to `YYYY/MM/DD`.

### Native form submit

When dealing with a native form which has an `action` and a `method` (eg. when using Quasar with ASP.NET controllers), you need to specify the `name` property on QDate, otherwise formData will not contain it (if it should):

<DocExample title="Native form" file="NativeForm" />
