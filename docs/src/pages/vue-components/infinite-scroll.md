The QInfiniteScroll component allows you to load new content as the user scrolls the page.

## QInfiniteScroll API

<doc-api file="QInfiniteScroll" />

## Usage

::: tip
Infinite Scroll loads items in advance when less than `offset` (default = 500) pixels is left to be seen. If the content you fetch has height less than the scroll target containerâ€™s height on screen then Infinite Scroll will continue loading more content. So make sure you load enough content.
:::

::: tip
In your `@load` function, don't forget to call the passed in `done()` function when you have finished loading more data.

### Tips
* Works best when placed as direct child of the Vue component rendering your Page
* If you change the parent of this component, don't forget to call `updateScrollTarget()` on the QInfiniteScroll Vue reference.
* If you need to specify the scroll target inner element (because the auto detected one is not the desired one) pass a CSS selector (as string) or the DOM element in the `scroll-target` prop

::: warning
If you pass a custom scroll target container with `scroll-target` prop you must make sure that the element exists and that it can be overflowed (it must have a maximum height and an overflow that allows scrolling).

If the scroll target container cannot be overflowed you'll get a forever loading situation.
