The QInfiteScroll component allows you to load new content as the user scrolls down the page.

## Installation
<doc-installation components="QInfiniteScroll" />

## Usage

::: tip
Infinite Scroll loads items in advance when less than `offset` (default = 500) pixels is left to be seen. If the content you fetch has height less than the containerâ€™s height on screen then Infinite Scroll will continue loading more content. So make sure you load enough content.
:::

::: tip
In your `@load` function, don't forget to call the passed in `done()` function when you have finsihed loading more data.
