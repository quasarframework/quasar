title: Quasar-Firebase Introduction
desc: Introduction of firebase and the integration and approach of working with firebase within a Quasar project

Firebase is Google's mobile platform that helps you quickly develop high-quality apps and grow your business. It initially was created as a startup in 2011, and was publicly available in 2012. In October of 2014 Google aquired Firebase, and has evolved into a platform that has 18 products and is currently being used by 1.5 million apps as of October 2018.

#### **If you're here, you have done two things:**

- Chosen the Quasar Framework to be your Vuejs front-end component framework
- Chosen Firebase at the minimum to handle your Quasar application's authentication... maybe more

The docs contained within are a set of guidelines to implement firebase's services within the context of the Quasar Framework. These docs will try to focus on implementations from a production standpoint.

Through out these firebase docs the intention is to have sample apps to highlight specific firebase features. These sample apps will share a consitant application strucuture providing a firebase service architecture for initialization and authenticaion. Other services will be separated for ease of matainance and context.

Firebase's doc references will be highlighted and linked for additional and further context explaination when needed, as well as referencing articles around the web that might offer even further insight or opinions on how to work with firebase.

If you have any questions or comments please submit a Docs PR, or find us in the #firebase channel on the Quasar Discord server.
