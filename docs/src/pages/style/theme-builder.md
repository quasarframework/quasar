One of the most important parts of a website/app is to build a brand for it. First step is to choose the brand colors that you are going to use and this is what the tool below helps you with.

## Theme Builder

Click on the colored buttons besides the layout below and when you are ready, hit the `Export` button at the bottom. Recommended way is to go with the Sass/SCSS form.

<theme-builder class="q-py-lg" />

::: tip TIPS
* Sass/SCSS is only available if you have Quasar v1.1.1+ and your project is managed by Quasar CLI through @quasar/app v1.1.0+.
* `dark` was added in Quasar v1.3.0.
