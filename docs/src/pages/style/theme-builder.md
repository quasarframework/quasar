One of the most important parts of a website/app is to build a brand for it. First step is to choose the brand colors that you are going to use and this is what the tool below helps you with.

## Theme Builder

Click on the colored buttons besides the layout below and when you are ready, hit the `Export` button at the bottom. Recommended way is to go with the Sass/SCSS form.
