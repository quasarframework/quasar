You can morph one DOM element into another (with animation) or between two states of the same element using Quasar's morph util.

## Basic usage

```js
import { morph } from 'quasar'

// Morph one DOM element to another:
morph({
  from: '#from-el',
  to: '#to-el'
})
```

## Function description

The function expects one mandatory parameter and two optional one and returns a function to cancel (revert) the morph.
- The first parameter (mandatory) must supply the elements the morph should refer to, in one of the following formats:
  - a single element (it will be used as both initial and final element), described as:
    - a DOM element
    - a CSS selector as string
    - a function returning a DOM element
  - an object having both **from** and **to** keys, each holding an element as described above
- The second parameter (optional) is a synchronous `toggle function` that will be executed immediately after the state of the initial element is saved.
  Use a function that toggles the state of the components so that the final element becomes available.
- The third parameter (optional) is the configuration user for morphing, It can be any of the following:
  - a number that will be used as the morphing duration
  - a function that will be used called when the morphing is finished
  - an object, with the following available options:
    - **waitFor** (default *0*) - a number, 'transitionend' or a Promise - it will delay animation start for that number of milliseconds, or until a 'transitionend' event is emitted by the destination element, or until the promise is resolved (if the promise is rejected the morphing will abort, but the `toggle function` was already called)
    - **duration** (default *300*) - the duration in milliseconds for the animation
    - **easing** (default *'ease-in-out'*) - the timing function for the animation
    - **delay** (default *0*) - the delay in milliseconds for the animation
    - **fill** (default *'none'*) - the fill mode for the animation
    - **style** - the extra style to be applied to the morphing element while it is animated (either as string or a CSSStyleDeclaration object)
    - **class** - the extra classes to be applied to the morphing element while it is animated (as string)
    - **forceResize** (default *false*) - by default the animation is using scale transform - set this flag to use resizing
    - **forceCssAnimation** (default *false*) - by default the animation is implemented using the Animation API (if available) - set this flag to use CSS animations
    - **hideFromClone** (default *false*) - by default a clone of the initial element is used to fill the space after the element is removed - set this flag if the initial element is not removed or resizing of the space occupied by the initial element is not desired
    - **keepToClone** (default *false*) - by default the final element is removed from it's final position to be animated - set this flag to keep a copy in the final position
    - **tween** (default *false*) - by default the final element is morphed from the position and aspect of the initial element to the ones of the final element - set this flag to use an opacity tween between the initial and final elements
    - **tweenFromOpacity** (default *0.6*) - if using **tween** it is the initial opacity of the initial element (will be animated to 0) - the initial element is placed on top of the final element
    - **tweenToOpacity** (default *0.5*) - if using **tween** it is the initial opacity of the final element (will be animated to 1)
    - **onReady** - a function that will be called once the morphing is finished - receives a single string parameter ('to' if the morphing was finished in the final state or 'from' if it was finished in the initial state)

## Morphing lifecycle

1. get the aspect and position of the initial element (if a function is provided for getting the initial element it will be called)
2. calculate the size and position of the container of the initial element
3. if another morphing was using the same element that morphing will be aborted
4. execute the `toggle function`
5. recalculate the size and position of the container of the initial element to check if they are changed
6. in the next tick (to allow Vue to process the state changes) the final element will be identified (if a function is provided for getting the final element it will be called)
7. if another morphing was using the same element that morphing will be aborted
8. calculate the size and position of the container of the final element
9. if a **waitFor** is provided, wait that number of milliseconds, for a 'transitionend' event or until the promise is resolved (if the promise is rejected then the morphing is aborted)
10. recalculate the size and position of the container of the final element to check if they are changed
11. get the aspect and position of the final element
12. start the animation

If the `cancel` function that was returned is called during steps 1 to 11 then the morphing will be aborted (the `toggle function` will still be called if the cancel comes after step 4) and the returned value will be **false**.
If the `cancel` function is called between the start and end of the animation then the animation will be reversed and the returned value will be **true**.
If the `cancel` function is called after the end of the animation nothing will happen and the returned value will be **false**.
