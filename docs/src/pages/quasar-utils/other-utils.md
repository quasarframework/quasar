## Open External URL

``` js
import { openURL } from 'quasar'

openURL('http://...')

// full syntax:
openURL(
  String url,
  Function rejectFn, // optional; gets called if window cannot be opened
  Object windowFeatures // (v1.13+) optional requested features for the new window
)
```

It will take care of the quirks involved when running under Cordova, Electron or on a browser, including notifying the user he/she has to acknowledge opening popups.

When wrapping with Cordova (or Capacitor), it's best (but not "a must do") if [InAppBrowser](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/reference/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser/) Cordova plugin is also installed, so that openURL can hook into that.

Starting with Quasar v1.11+, if running on iOS and [cordova-plugin-safariviewcontroller](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/cordova-plugin-safariviewcontroller) is installed, then openURL will first try to hook into it.

The optional `windowFeatures` parameter should be an Object with keys from [window.open() windowFeatures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open) and Boolean values (as described in the example below). Please note that these features will not be taken into account when openURL does not deferrs to using `window.open()` (like for example when it hooks into InAppBrowser or the electron's own window opener).

```js
// example of openURL() with windowFeatures:
// (requires Quasar v1.13+)

openURL(
  'http://...',
  null, // in this example we don't care about the rejectFn()

  // this is the windowFeatures Object param:
  {
    noopener: true, // this is set by default for security purposes
                    // but it can be disabled if specified with a Boolean false value
    menubar: true,
    toolbar: true,
    noreferrer: true,
    // .....any other window features
  }
)
```

::: tip
If you want to open the telephone dialer in a Cordova app, don't use `openURL()`. Instead you should directly use `<a href="tel:123456789">` tags or `<QBtn type="a" href="tel:123456789">`

## Copy to Clipboard <q-badge align="top" color="brand-primary" label="v1.5+" />

The following is a helper to copy some text to Clipboard. The method returns a Promise.

``` js
import { copyToClipboard } from 'quasar'

copyToClipboard('some text')
  .then(() => {
    // success!
  })
  .catch(() => {
    // fail
  })
```

## Export file <q-badge align="top" color="brand-primary" label="v1.5+" />

The following is a helper to trigger a file download.

``` js
import { exportFile } from 'quasar'

// mimeType is optional;
// default mimeType is "text/plain"
(status) exportFile(fileName, rawData[, mimeType])
```

The simplest example:

``` js
import { exportFile } from 'quasar'

const status = exportFile('important.txt', 'Some important content')

if (status === true) {
  // browser allowed it
}
else {
  // browser denied it
  console.log('Error: ' + status)
}
```

## Debounce Function
If your App uses JavaScript to accomplish taxing tasks, a debounce function is essential to ensuring a given task doesn't fire so often that it bricks browser performance. Debouncing a function limits the rate at which the function can fire.

Debouncing enforces that a function not be called again until a certain amount of time has passed without it being called. As in "execute this function only if 100 milliseconds have passed without it being called."

A quick example: you have a resize listener on the window which does some element dimension calculations and (possibly) repositions a few elements. That isn't a heavy task in itself but being repeatedly fired after numerous resizes will really slow your App down. So why not limit the rate at which the function can fire?

``` js
// Returns a function, that, as long as it continues to be invoked, will not
// be triggered. The function will be called after it stops being called for
// N milliseconds. If `immediate` is passed, trigger the function on the
// leading edge, instead of the trailing.
import { debounce } from 'quasar'

(Debounced Function) debounce(Function fn, Number milliseconds_to_wait, Boolean immediate)

// Example:
window.addEventListener(
  'resize',
  debounce(function() {
    // .... things to do ...
  }, 300 /*ms to wait*/)
)
```

Or calling as a method in a .vue file:

```js
methods: {
  myMethod () { .... }
},

created () {
  this.myMethod = debounce(this.myMethod, 500)
}
```

::: warning
Debouncing your functions using a method declaration like `myMethod: debounce(function () { // Code }, 500)` will mean that the debounced method will be shared between *all* rendered instances of this component, so debouncing is also shared. Moreover, `this.myMethod.cancel()` won't work, because Vue wraps each method with another function to ensure proper `this` binding. This should be avoided by following the code snippet above.
:::

There's also a `frameDebounce` available which delays calling your function until next browser frame is scheduled to run (read about `requestAnimationFrame`).

``` js
import { frameDebounce } from 'quasar'

(Debounced Function) frameDebounce(Function fn)

// Example:
window.addEventListener(
  'resize',
  frameDebounce(function() {
    .... things to do ...
  })
)
```

## Throttle Function
Throttling enforces a maximum number of times a function can be called over time. As in "execute this function at most once every X milliseconds."

``` js
import { throttle } from 'quasar'

(Throttled Function) throttle(Function fn, Number limit_in_milliseconds)

// Example:
window.addEventListener(
  'resize',
  throttle(function() {
    .... things to do ...
  }, 300 /* execute at most once every 0.3s */)
)
```

Or calling as a method in a .vue file:

```js
methods: {
  myMethod () { .... }
},

created () {
  this.myMethod = throttle(this.myMethod, 500)
}
```

::: warning
Throttling your functions using a method declaration like `myMethod: throttle(function () { // Code }, 500)` will mean that the throttled method will be shared between *all* rendered instances of this component, so throttling is also shared. This should be avoided by following the code snippet above.
:::

## (Deep) Copy Objects
A basic respawn of `jQuery.extend()`. Takes same parameters:

``` js
import { extend } from 'quasar'

let newObject = extend([Boolean deepCopy], targetObj, obj, ...)
```

Watch out for methods within objects.

## Generate UID
Generate unique identifiers:

``` js
import { uid } from 'quasar'

let uid = uid()
// Example: 501e7ae1-7e6f-b923-3e84-4e946bff31a8
```

## Handling event on a DOM event handler
It's cross-browser.

``` js
import { event } from 'quasar'

node.addEventListener('click', evt => {
  // left clicked?
  (Boolean) event.leftClick(evt)

  // middle clicked?
  (Boolean) event.middleClick(evt)

  // right clicked?
  (Boolean) event.rightClick(evt)

  // key in number format
  (Number) event.getEventKey(evt)

  // Mouse wheel distance (in pixels)
  (Object {x, y}) event.getMouseWheelDistance(evt)

  // position on viewport
  // works both for mouse and touch events!
  (Object {top, left}) event.position(evt)

  // get target DOM Element on which mouse or touch
  // event has fired upon
  (DOM Element) event.targetElement(evt)

  // call stopPropagation and preventDefault
  event.stopAndPrevent(evt)
})
```
