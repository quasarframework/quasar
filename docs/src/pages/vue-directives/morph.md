"Morph" is a Quasar directive that provides the ability to morph DOM elements between two states.

Under the covers, it uses the [DOM morph function](/quasar-utils/dom-utils#Morphing-DOM-elements).

## Installation

<doc-installation directives="Morph" />

## Usage

Reading the [DOM morph function](/quasar-utils/dom-utils#Morphing-DOM-elements) first will be best in your understanding of how this directive works.

This directive morphs one element in a group into another. The morphing is activated by changing the value of the directive (or the `trigger` key of the object passed to the directive if a configuration object is used).
If the trigger value is **falsy** then the element is hidden, else the element is morphed from the currently visible element.
