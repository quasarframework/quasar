title: Close Menu Directive
---

Starting with Quasar v1.0.0-beta.11, it is recommended that you use [ClosePopup](/vue-directives/close-popup) directive instead, with same API but with additional functionality.

Vue directive `v-close-menu` will still work (until Quasar v1.0.0-rc.1 will arrive) but will display a console.log() message when on development mode (informing you to replace it with `v-close-popup`).
