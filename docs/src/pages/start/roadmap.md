title: Quasar Roadmap
desc: What's next for Quasar Framework.
---

Where will Quasar be in one year, five years or ten years? It's up to you, the developers using Quasar.

You, the community, are Quasar. We listen to your opinions and your needs. Which is why we encourage you to directly contact us on [Discord](https://chat.quasar.dev) or submit [Feature Requests](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar/issues/new/choose). We carefully ponder on all the ideas and we decide along with the community what are the next steps to be taken.

Apart from the constant new components/directives/Quasar plugins that we have on our todo list, the next really big things on our plate currently are:
* Upgrade to Vue 3 (once it is shipped)
* Highly improve Typescript support (dedicated team members working on it)
* Upgrade Quasar App CLI to Webpack 5
