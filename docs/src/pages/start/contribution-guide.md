The Quasar team gets really excited and is totally appreciative, when people help by contributing to Quasar. It's what the FLOSS community is all about!

### Developing the Core
Quasar is a great framework. However, there are still tons of features waiting to be developed, in order to make the Quasar experience even better. Please check out [the Quasar Github repo](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar) or contact [Razvan Stoenescu](https://github.com/rstoenescu) via emial or directly through [Discord chat](https://discord.gg/5TDhbDg), if you are interested in helping with the core software.

### Creating App Extensions
Or, you can help out by creating [App Extensions](/quasar-cli/app-extensions/introduction). Quasar's App Extensions can be components, new CLI commands and completely new functionality. They represent a major step forward for Quasar as a RAD framework.

### Helping out with Documentation
Another great way to contribute, is to support with the creation and upkeep of the documentation. If you catch and want to correct a spelling or grammar mistake or want to add a tip to a page or an added code example, use the link (the pencil icon) at the top right of each page of the docs. This link will take you to staight to an editor on Github (requires registration) to make your changes or improvements. 

::: tip A LAST HUMBLE REQUEST 
If you'd like, you could leave a buck or two for coffee from time to time. Quasar needs financial backing to evolve. [We'd love it, if you could help out!](/sponsors-and-backers#Donating).
