title: Getting Started - Pick a Quasar Flavour
desc: 'Get started with Quasar by picking one of its flavours: Quasar CLI, Vue CLI or UMD'
---

**If you'd like to learn more about what Quasar can do for you**, read the [Introduction to Quasar](/introduction-to-quasar). Otherwise, let's get started by choosing how you'd like to use Quasar.

There are three ways of using Quasar. Pick the one that suits you best:

- [UMD/Standalone](/start/umd) (embed into an existing project through CDN, progressive integration)
- [Quasar CLI](/start/quasar-cli) (**the premium developer experience for free, recommended**)
- [Vue CLI 3 plugin](/start/vue-cli-plugin)

Here's a quick comparison:

::: tip Footnote for above
\* Cross-platform support with Vue CLI is handled by community plugins. These are not tightly integrated with Quasar as with Quasar CLI and so they may have issues. Also, Quasar CLI ensures Quasar is used at its best (including performance-wise).
