title: Directory Structure
desc: (@quasar/app-vite) The structure of a Quasar app with explanations for each folder and file.
---
This is the structure of a project with all modes installed. There's no reason to be intimidated though!

::: tip
If you are a beginner, all you'll need to care about is `/quasar.config.js` (Quasar App Config file), `/src/router`, `/src/layouts`, `/src/pages` and optionally `/src/assets`.
